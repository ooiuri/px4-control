# libfc-sensor-api

## Introduction

This is the public API for the proprietary fc sensor library. It is used as a
submodule for the fc sensor library and for any projects that utilize that
library. The source is for a stub library that can be built and linked against
but the actual proprietary library will need to be installed during run time.
