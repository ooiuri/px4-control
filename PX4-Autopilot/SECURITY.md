## Reporting a Vulnerability

We currently only receive security vulnerability reports through GitHub.

To begin a report, please go to the top-level repository, for example, PX4/PX4-Autopilot,
and click on the Security tab. If you are on mobile, click the ... dropdown menu, and then click Security.

Click Report a Vulnerability to open the advisory form. Fill in the advisory details form.
Make sure your title is descriptive, and the development team can find all of the relevant details needed
to verify on the description box. We recommend you add as much data as possible. We welcome logs,
screenshots, photos, and videos, anything that can help us verify and identify the issues being reported.

At the bottom of the form, click Submit report. The maintainer team will be notified and will get back to you ASAP.
